# Fake News Detection System

## Research Paper: "A Hybrid Approach to Fake News Detection: Combining Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Processing, and Multi-Source Verification"

### Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of an automated fake news detection system that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with multi-source verification. The system utilizes sentiment analysis, text summarization, and cross-referencing with multiple news sources to assess the credibility of news articles. The implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of combining machine learning techniques with web scraping for enhanced news verification.

#### 4.2 Key Algorithms and Mathematical Models

##### Sentiment Analysis
The sentiment score (S) for a given text is calculated using the following formula:

\[ S = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot p_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i} \]

Where:
- \( w_i \) = weight of the i-th word
- \( p_i \) = polarity score of the i-th word (-1 to 1)
- \( n \) = total number of words

##### Text Summarization
The importance score (I) for a sentence is calculated using:

\[ I(s) = \alpha \cdot TF(s) + \beta \cdot POS(s) + \gamma \cdot POSITION(s) \]

Where:
- \( TF(s) \) = Term Frequency of the sentence
- \( POS(s) \) = Part-of-Speech score
- \( POSITION(s) \) = Position score of the sentence
- \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) = Weight parameters (sum to 1)

##### Source Verification
The credibility score (C) for a news source is calculated as:

\[ C = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m} v_i \cdot r_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{m} v_i} \]

Where:
- \( v_i \) = Verification score from i-th source
- \( r_i \) = Reliability weight of i-th source
- \( m \) = Number of verification sources

##### Final Fake News Probability
The probability (P) that an article is fake news is calculated using:

\[ P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\alpha S + \beta C + \gamma I)}} \]

Where:
- \( S \) = Sentiment score
- \( C \) = Credibility score
- \( I \) = Information consistency score
- \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) = Weight parameters

### 5. Results and Analysis
#### 5.1 Performance Metrics
The system's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

##### Accuracy
\[ Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} \]

##### Precision
\[ Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} \]

##### Recall
\[ Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \]

##### F1-Score
\[ F1 = 2 \cdot \frac{Precision \cdot Recall}{Precision + Recall} \]

Where:
- TP = True Positives
- TN = True Negatives
- FP = False Positives
- FN = False Negatives
